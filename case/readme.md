## Sleeve

I bought a 2x6 pins [PCB connector](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33015746310.html).
I designed a sleeve for that, that is supposed to look a bit like the original:

This is my version.
The [stl](sleeve-square.stl) is in the repo.

## Tapuino Case

I also made a casing for the Tapuino itself.
I wanted it to look like the original datasette.

This is the result of a couple of evenings with Fusion 360.

It consists of a [top half](ShellTop.stl) and a [bottom half](ShellBot.stl).
The top half has a black [inlay](Inlay.stl).
